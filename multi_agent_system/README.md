# Multi-Agent System for Automated Task Orchestration

## Overview

This project is a modular, extensible **multi-agent system** designed to automate complex tasks by orchestrating specialized AI agents. It is ideal for interview preparation, research, content creation, data analysis, and more. The system demonstrates agentic AI principles: **delegation, collaboration, and autonomous workflow execution**.

## Architecture

### Core Agents

- **Manager Agent**: Orchestrates the workflow, delegates tasks, and synthesizes final responses.
- **Researcher Agent**: Gathers information using web search and research tools.
- **Writer Agent**: Generates content (articles, blogs, reports) using research data.
- **Critic Agent**: Reviews and validates content for quality and accuracy.
- **Analyst Agent**: Performs data analysis and provides insights.

### Communication & Coordination

- **TaskCoordinator**: Manages project plans, task queues, and agent assignments.
- **MessageHub**: Handles inter-agent communication and conversation history.

### Tools

- **Web Search Tool**: Simulates or performs real web searches for up-to-date information.
- **Content Processing Tools**: For summarization, paraphrasing, and SEO optimization.
- **Data Analysis Tools**: For statistical analysis and insight generation.
- **Quality Validation Tools**: For grammar, style, and factual accuracy checks.

### Memory Systems

- **SharedMemory**: Stores facts, results, and project data accessible by all agents.
- **Conversation History**: Maintains logs of all user and agent interactions.

## How to Use

### 1. **Setup**

- Ensure you have Python 3.10+ and all dependencies installed.
- Run the system using:
  ```
  uv run main_system.py
  ```

### 2. **Interact**

- Enter natural language requests, e.g.:
  - `Write a short article about artificial intelligence.`
  - `Research the latest trends in renewable energy.`
  - `Analyze customer feedback data and provide insights.`
- Use commands:
  - `status` — Show current project/task status.
  - `history` — Show recent conversation.
  - `reset` — Start a new session.
  - `help` — Show example requests.
  - `quit` — Exit the system.

### 3. **Workflow**

1. **User submits a request.**
2. **Manager Agent** analyzes and breaks down the request into tasks.
3. **Specialist Agents** (Researcher, Writer, Critic, Analyst) execute their tasks in sequence.
4. **Manager Agent** synthesizes the results and presents a final response.
5. **Critic Agent** may trigger revisions if quality is insufficient.

## How to Approach Problems with This System

- **Decompose**: Break complex problems into smaller, specialized tasks.
- **Delegate**: Assign tasks to the most suitable agent/tool.
- **Iterate**: Use the Critic Agent to review and trigger improvements.
- **Integrate**: Combine results from multiple agents for a comprehensive answer.
- **Automate**: Let the system handle repetitive or multi-step workflows.

## Scaling & Extending the Project

### 1. **Add More Agents**
- Implement new agents for domains like legal, finance, coding, etc.
- Register them with the Manager Agent.

### 2. **Integrate Real Tools**
- Connect to real web search APIs (e.g., Bing, Google).
- Use advanced NLP models (OpenAI, HuggingFace, etc.).
- Plug in external data sources or databases.

### 3. **Enhance Memory**
- Use persistent storage (databases) for long-term memory.
- Implement knowledge graphs for richer context.

### 4. **Improve Coordination**
- Add advanced scheduling, prioritization, and parallel task execution.
- Enable agents to negotiate or collaborate dynamically.

### 5. **User Interface**
- Build a web or chat UI for easier interaction.
- Add visualization for workflows and agent status.

### 6. **Security & Reliability**
- Add authentication, logging, and error recovery.
- Monitor agent performance and system health.

## Example Use Cases

- **Interview Preparation**: Simulate multi-step research, writing, and critique cycles.
- **Content Generation**: Automate blog, report, or summary creation.
- **Market Analysis**: Gather and analyze data for business insights.
- **Educational Tools**: Generate study guides, quizzes, or explanations.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If you see fallback responses, check agent connections and tool integrations.
- Use the `status` and `history` commands to debug workflows.
- Review logs for errors in agent execution or communication.
